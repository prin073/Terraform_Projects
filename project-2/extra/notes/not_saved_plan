Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.

âœ… What it means:
When you run:
terraform plan
You may see:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
This just tells you:

Terraform created a plan, but didn't save it to a file.

So if you run terraform apply later, Terraform will re-calculate the plan, which may result in different changes if the infrastructure or variables have changed in the meantime.

ðŸ’¡ If you want to save the plan:
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
This guarantees Terraform will apply exactly what was planned.

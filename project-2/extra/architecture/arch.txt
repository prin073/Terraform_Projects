🧱 1. Getting Ready – Find the Default Network (VPC and Subnets)
Before building anything:

VPC = your cloud "neighborhood" (a virtual private network).

Subnets = different "streets" in that neighborhood.

You tell AWS:

"Hey, give me the default network and the streets (subnets) in it – I’ll build my stuff there."

🔐 2. Security Group – Set the Rules for the Doors
Think of a security group like a bouncer at the door:

Who can come in and what door (port) they can use.

Who can go out.

You tell the bouncer:

Allow people to come in through port 8080 (our web app).

Also allow port 80 (standard web).

And let me in via SSH on port 22 to manage the servers.

Let all traffic go out freely.

🖥️ 3. Create Two Web Servers (EC2 Instances)
You create two virtual computers (servers) in the cloud:

Each one says "Hello World" in a file.

Each one runs a small web server (like a tiny version of Apache or Nginx).

They serve their "Hello World" message on port 8080.

They’re like:

“I’m a tiny website! Visit me on 8080!”

🌐 4. Create a Load Balancer – Like a Traffic Cop
Imagine a traffic cop standing in front of the two web servers.

The Load Balancer:

Accepts visitors from the internet on port 80 (normal browser access).

Then it forwards them to one of the web servers on port 8080.

It also checks if a server is healthy before sending traffic to it.

So it’s like:

"Welcome! Let me direct you to a healthy server."

🎯 5. Target Group – Who the Load Balancer Can Talk To
You tell the Load Balancer:

"These are the servers (EC2 instances) you can send visitors to."

This is called a Target Group, and you add both servers to it.

🔗 6. Listener – What Should Happen When Someone Visits
The Listener is like the Load Balancer’s ear:

It listens on port 80.

When someone arrives, it says:

"Okay, let’s forward them to one of the healthy web servers on 8080."

🌍 7. Future Step – Add a Domain Name (DNS)
Right now, visitors access your site using a long AWS link like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://load-balancer-1234.amazonaws.com
With Route 53, you can later set a custom domain like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://mywebsite.com
So people don’t have to remember that ugly link.

💡 The Big Picture
Visitors 🧑‍💻 → Load Balancer 🌐 (port 80) → Listener 🎧 → Target Group 🎯 → Web Server 🖥️ (port 8080) → "Hello World" page

That’s it!

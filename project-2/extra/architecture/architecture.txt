In this architecture we need to go inside s3_backend and run tf apply to create and copy tfstate file to 
remote bukcet and again come out of that and run main.tf which wiull creqate a new tfstate file . 
now there is 2 different tfstate file. How it works

🎯 Goal of This Architecture
We want to:

Provision the remote backend (S3 + DynamoDB) using Terraform

Then, use that backend to store all future Terraform state

Avoid a chicken-and-egg problem: we can't use a remote backend until it's created

🧠 How It Works — Step by Step
✅ 1. Bootstrap Backend (Local State)
You go into the modules/s3_backend folder and run:

cd modules/s3_backend
terraform init            # Uses LOCAL backend by default
terraform apply           # Creates S3 bucket + DynamoDB
This temporarily uses local state (terraform.tfstate in that folder)

It provisions:

An S3 bucket to store future state

A DynamoDB table for state locking

👉 At this point, the backend infra exists, but your main Terraform project isn't using it yet.

✅ 2. Configure Remote Backend (Outside the Module)
Back in the root of your project (terraform-project/), you now have a file like backend.tf:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-tf-backend-bucket"
    key            = "envs/dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
This tells Terraform:

“Hey, going forward, store my state in this S3 bucket instead of locally.”

✅ 3. Run Terraform Init (and Migrate State)
Now you run:

cd ../../  # Back to root
terraform init
Terraform detects the backend block and prompts:

Terraform detected that the backend type changed from "local" to "s3".
Do you want to migrate your state to the new backend?
➡️ Say YES

It will:

Move the local terraform.tfstate file from root into the S3 bucket

Start using remote state for all future runs

✅ Summary: Why 2 States and Why It Works
Stage	Location	Purpose
Step 1 (bootstrap)	modules/s3_backend/	Local-only, temporary. Creates backend
Step 2 (main project)	terraform-project/	Migrates to and uses remote backend

You do not reuse the s3_backend module's state — it exists only to bootstrap.

Once the backend is ready and remote is configured, only the remote state is used.

You can later remove or archive the local s3_backend/terraform.tfstate.

🧩 Bonus Tip (Production Best Practice)
You can separate this even more cleanly by having:

terraform-bootstrap/         # Own Terraform project just for backend infra
terraform-infra/             # Your actual infrastructure project
This way, each project has one clear purpose and no state files overlap.

==================================================================================================

When you run terraform init, Terraform automatically loads all .tf files in the current directory. This means:

✅ How Terraform Works:
Terraform does not look for a specific filename (like main.tf or provider.tf) — instead, it:

Loads all .tf files in the current working directory.

Merges their content into a single internal configuration.

So, backend.tf, provider.tf, main.tf, etc. all get processed together.

===========================================================
Q: How tfstate gets stored to remote?
🧱 terraform-bootstrap/: Creates Backend Infra
Purpose: Sets up the S3 bucket + DynamoDB table that will later hold the remote state.

State Location: By default, local terraform.tfstate file in this folder:

terraform-bootstrap/terraform.tfstate
➕ Notes:
This local state file tracks the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table.

You do not configure a backend here — because you can’t use a backend that hasn’t been created yet.

You usually run this only once (or very rarely) unless you're changing backend infra.

🏗 terraform-infra/: Real Infra Managed with Remote State
Purpose: This is where you define and manage actual infrastructure — EC2, RDS, etc.

State Location: Remote, defined in backend.tf:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-tf-state-bucket-123456"
    key            = "envs/dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
➕ Notes:
When you run terraform init in terraform-infra/, Terraform:

Connects to the remote S3 backend.

Creates (or reuses) the remote state file at envs/dev/terraform.tfstate.

Stores all future state there.

Locks the state during apply/plan using DynamoDB.

💡 Important Distinction
Project	Backend Defined?	State Location	Use Case
terraform-bootstrap/	❌ No	Local (terraform.tfstate)	Bootstrap backend infrastructure
terraform-infra/	✅ Yes	Remote (S3 + DynamoDB)	Real infrastructure management

🚀 Real-Life Flow Recap
Run terraform apply in terraform-bootstrap/

Creates S3 + DynamoDB

Local .tfstate saved here

Move to terraform-infra/, run:

terraform init
terraform apply
Remote backend initialized

State now stored and locked remotely

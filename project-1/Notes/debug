🔍 Top 3 Final Checks
✅ 1. Did You Try Accessing With http://<public-ip>?
Use HTTP, not HTTPS. Apache on port 80 doesn't handle HTTPS unless you configured SSL separately.

Example:


http://3.91.XX.XX
✅ 2. Verify Public IP Was Actually Assigned
Run this on the instance:

curl ifconfig.me
This will return the external public IP your server sees.

Compare it with the AWS Console public IP.

If it returns a private IP (like 10.0.x.x), then:

associate_public_ip_address = true didn’t take effect, likely because:

You’re using a custom VPC and subnet, and didn’t enable auto-assign public IP at the subnet level.

✅ Solution:
You need to explicitly set this in Terraform (which you already did), and make sure subnet settings allow it.

Fix the subnet using AWS Console:

Go to VPC → Subnets → subnet-1

Click "Edit subnet settings"

Enable: Auto-assign public IPv4 address

✅ 3. Check Network Interface
Run this to confirm public IP attached:

bash
Copy
Edit
ip addr show
If you don’t see an interface with a public IP, then again the IP was not properly assigned.

🧩 Final Fix Recommendation
If you're using this config block in aws_instance:

hcl
Copy
Edit
associate_public_ip_address = true
But still no public IP, then your subnet defaults are blocking the assignment.

🔧 Two Fixes:
Terraform fix: Replace with an aws_eip attachment if you want to always get a public IP reliably.

Or simpler: Just edit subnet in AWS Console and enable auto-assign public IPv4.

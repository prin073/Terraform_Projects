✅ terraform taint — What It Does
The terraform taint command marks a resource for destruction so it is recreated during the next terraform apply.

This is especially useful when:

You changed user_data (which only runs on EC2 creation).

You want to force re-provisioning without changing other config.

✅ Example
To force recreation of your EC2 instances:

terraform taint aws_instance.web_app_instance1
terraform taint aws_instance.web_app_instance2
Then apply:

terraform apply
Terraform will:

Destroy both instances.

Create fresh instances.

Run updated user_data.
